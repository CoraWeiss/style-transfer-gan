# Style Transfer GAN Project Context

This project implements a GAN for artistic style transfer using PyTorch. Key components:

## Structure
- /style_transfer_gan/
  - data/data_loader.py: Handles dataset loading and preprocessing
  - models/: Contains Generator and Discriminator architectures
  - outputs/: Generated images stored every 5 epochs
  - train.py: Main training loop

## Technical Details
- Training: 100 epochs, batch size 32, lr 0.0001
- Architecture: DCGAN-inspired with 64x64 RGB output
- Dataset: Collection of style reference images
- Generated images: Viewable in outputs/ named fake_images_epoch_X.png

## Development History
- Built in GitHub Codespaces
- Used PyTorch for deep learning
- Designed custom dataset loader for style images
- Implemented real-time generation monitoring
- Trained on ~100 style reference images

## Known Issues/Improvements
- Could benefit from larger image resolution
- Consider adding style loss metrics
- Add image preprocessing options

## Tips for Continuation
- Check outputs/ for training progression
- Key parameters in train.py for tuning
- Data loader supports .jpg, .jpeg, and .png
- Consider implementing style transfer loss
